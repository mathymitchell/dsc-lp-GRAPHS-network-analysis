#### Lesson Summary:

This lesson introduces graph/network theory. It begins with some background of potential use cases of network graphs and moves on to cover basic terminology. From there, cliques, node centrality and the Girvan-Newman algorithm are investigated including introducing conducting these analyses in practice using networkX.


#### Topic:

Network / Graph Theory


#### Learning goals for this lesson:

* Students will be able to discuss the components of a network graph
